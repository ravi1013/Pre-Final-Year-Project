Automatic Teller Machine For Visually Impaired People
I have worked on a project named as “Automatic Teller Machine for Visually Impaired People” in my Pre-Final Year. The main objective of the project is, People With visual impairment or low vision and illiterate people faces barriers in accessing electronic machines. Government is also mandating banking sectors to provide services to them. Moreover, some guidelines are set by Government for standard interfaces on talking ATMs. Thus, by installation of such ATMs will provide visual as well as audio access to people.
